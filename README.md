# Algorithm Visualiser

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualization project! This project is designed to help you visualize various sorting algorithms. Currently, it supports the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Demo
You can check the live demo of the project [here](https://garvit-exe.github.io/Algorithm-Visualiser).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Code editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/garvit-exe/Algorithm-Visualiser.git

## Usage

- Select an algorithm from the dropdown list.
- Enter data (comma-separated) in the input field.
- Click the "Visualize" button.

Watch the algorithm in action as it sorts the data, and visualizes each step.

## Supported Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
